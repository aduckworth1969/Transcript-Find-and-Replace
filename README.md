# Transcript-Find-and-Replace

This application will process transcript files from WebEx, Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The processing will remove unnecessary words, like "um" and "uh", and 
replace user-identified words that are commonly mis-transcribed, like acronyms and formal names. The user will add these mis-transcribed words along with 
their replacements to a .csv file that will be imported to the application.
